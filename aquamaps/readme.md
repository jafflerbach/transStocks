This AquaMaps folder holds three things:

1. hcaf_truncated.csv is all half degree cells used by aquamaps
2. speciesoccursum.csv is the list of aquamaps species
3. am_spp_cells_ram.csv is a truncated list of the species probability occurrence by cell. This data is limited only to those species that are found in the RAM database. The full set would be too large for github
